 This script will calculate and show PCR mix using provided reagents table with the stock- and working concentrations of the PCR reagents ("table" argument indicates tsv file with reagents and its concentrations)\n,
 - Listing: use "list" command to list all reagents used. Use "tlist" command to list all available in the current directory tables of reagents (.tsv files). "tlist" command (stops program execution) may be used solitary or as an equation with the path to a directory to be listed, e.g. tlist=/some_dir/some_dir/\n,
 - Primers: primers in the template table file MUST starts with "f :" or "r:" (names could be redefined using arguments "forward" and "reverse". New names must be enveloped by double quotes (e.g. forward="ITR2f").\n,
 - Must-be-defined reagents: \nReaction "volume" ("vol", "v"), "number" ("num", "n") of samples, "template" volume ("template_volume", "tv", "dna_volume", "dnav", "sample_volume", "sv").\n,
 - Hide reagents: "hide" argument with list of reagents separated by "|" or ";" may be used to hide some lines in a resulting table and exclude their volume from the volume to dispense. They will still be considered in calculations.\n,
 - Exclude reagents: if some reagent should be one-time excluded from mix, but not from the used table of reagents - use "exclude" ("ex") argument(separate reagents by "|" or ";").\n,
 - Add reagents: to add some reagents without table modification use construction like: add="some_1,100,1,g|some_2,32,2,mM" where some_1 and some_2 - reagents, 100 and 32 - stock concentrations, 1 and 2 - work concentrations and g and mM - units to use. N.B. "Exclude" command has a higher priority than "add" command in case of overlap.\n,
 - Change concentrations: the stock and working concentrations (and corresponding units) for each reagent described in the reagent table can be overridden using such constructions: "~reagent=Cstock,Cwork,units" when programm started in CLI or using construction "change=reagent_1,Cstock,Cwork,units[|reagent_n,Cstock,Cwork,units]". All positions must be filled: reagent_name, C_stock, C_work, Units. Those values that have not to be changed may be replaced with commas (including units). Alternatively "~reagent_name=N" (change="reagent_name,N" in the jupyter context) constructions may be used to override only work concentration. Added reagents could not be redefined. To change primers concentrations f: and r: prefixes should precede actual names of forward and reverse primers correspondingly.\n,
 - Default output html file - pcr_mixN.html - may be redefined using argument "html" or "output", "o".\n,
 - The "--silent" parameter prevents the browser window from opening.\nYou may define web browser to output resulting table. Use "browser="some_browser"" construction. Available browser names are: "firefox", "netscape", "galeon", "epiphany", "skipstone", "mosaic", "opera", "grail", "links", "elinks", "lynx", "w3m", "windows-default", "macosx", "safari", "google-chrome", "chrome", "chromium", "chromium-browser",
 - "nopromt" parameter force program do not ask for correct table filename.
